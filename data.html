Chapters in the book illustrate the novel ways in which the right to water has been taken up in locations drawn globally, highlighting the material Politics that are enabled and negotiated through this framework in order to address ongoing water insecurities. This book reflects the urgent need to take stock of debates in light of new concerns around post-neoliberal political developments, the challenges of the Anthropocene and climate change, the transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as the mobilizations around the right to water in the global North.

The intimate relationship between Politics and literature, which Shahid rigorously explored in The Country Without a Post Office, is the true question posed on page after page of How Many Countries Does the Indus Cross. The answers will astonish readers,Using frank eroticism, surreptitious rhymes, and a molecular understanding of how History seeps into our lives, Akhil Katyal seamlessly entwines the political and the poetical. In poems addressed to dead friends and lost lovers, to vanished poets and remembered cities, he reminds us that Poetry's subjects and pleasures are everywhere.Violent histories are being made every day, if not every moment, in Contemporary India. Akhil Katyal is one of the finest new generation poets who makes lasting poetic documents out of these histories. The poems in this book deal remarkably with our external realities-a News report, an unnoticed tragedy, a loss-and interiorizes them with a fine acumen, an eye for structure and varied dictions. It's a marvel to see how brilliantly he uses Personal memories to express the ironies of our troubled times",

        details:"Language: EnglishPages: 117 (Throughout Color and B/W Illustrations)About The BookTo the faithful, everyday mentioned in the Mahabharata is true to the very letter, whereas the skeptic holds that h e epic is nothing more than a mere figment of imagination. How , then, can one ascertain the truth? It is here that Archaeology comes to our rescue.IN 1951-52, Professor B.B. Lal excavated the key-site of Hastinapura, situated on the bank of the Ganga, in Merut district o f Uttar Pradesh. Over here he encountered in the lower Levels a settlement which was distinguished by a characteristic pottery called the painted Grey Ware, assignable to circa 1100-800 BCE. This PGW Culture has since been discovered at all the Mahabharata sites a feature which binds them together.Further, the excavation revealed that a heavy flood in the Ganga destroyed a considerable portion of the Painted Grey Ware settlement at Hastinapura. This archaeological evidence is duly corroborated by the vayu Purnan which states: “When the city of Hastinpura is carried away by the Ganga, Nichksu will abandon it and dwell in Kausambi.”The shifting of the capital from Hastinapura to Kausambi is, in turn, supported by the fact that in the lowest Levels of Kausambi has been encountered the same kind of degenerated Painted Grey Ware as had begun to appear at Hastinapura prior to its destruction by the flood.Thus, the combined evidence of Archaeology and Literature duly establishes that the Mahabharata is not a figment of imagination but has a basis in historical reality. At the same time, it is on record that the epic underwent eleven time inflation-from 8,800 to 1,00,000 verses- and hence it is difficult to separate the Wheat from the chaff. But let not the precious Wheat be thrown away with the chaf",

        details:"A major new History of how the Enlightenment transformed people's everyday lives The Secular Enlightenment is a panoramic account of the radical ways that life began to change for ordinary people in the age of Locke, Voltaire, and Rousseau. In this landmark book, familiar Enlightenment figures share places with voices that have remained largely unheard until now, from freethinkers and freemasons to French materialists, anticlerical Catholics, pantheists, pornographers, readers, and travelers. Margaret Jacob, one of our most esteemed historians of the Enlightenment, reveals how this newly secular outlook was not a wholesale rejection of Christianity but rather a new mental space in which to encounter the world on its own terms. She takes readers from London and Amsterdam to Berlin, Vienna, Turin, and Naples, drawing on rare archival materials to show how ideas central to the emergence of secular democracy touched all facets of daily life. Human frailties once attributed to sin were now viewed through the lens of the newly conceived social sciences. People entered churches not to pray but to admire the architecture, and spent their Sunday mornings reading a newspaper or even a risqu book. The secular-minded pursued their own temporal and commercial well-being without concern for the life hereafter, regarding their successes as the rewards for their actions, their failures as the result of blind economic forces. A majestic work of intellectual and cultural History, The Secular Enlightenment demonstrates how secular values and pursuits took hold of eighteenth-century Europe, spilled into the American colonies, and left their lasting imprint on the Western world for generations to come.",

Renfrew begins by looking at Prehistory as a discipline, detailing how breakthroughs such as radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis have helped us to define humankind’s past–how things have changed–much more clearly than was possible just a half century ago. As for why things have changed, Renfrew pinpoints some of the issues and challenges, past and present, that confront the study of Prehistory and its investigators. Renfrew then offers a summary of human Prehistory from early hominids to the rise of literate civilization that is refreshingly free of conventional wisdom and grand “unified” theories. In this invaluable account, Colin Renfrew delivers a meticulously researched and passionately argued chronicle about our life on earth–and our ongoing quest to understand it",

        details:"In his 1934 book, The Science and Fine Art of Fasting, Herbert M. Shelton outlined his Theory that fasting is a key component in promoting healing. The book's ideas run counter to the well-known conventional wisdom that those who are sick must eat to keep up their strength and posits that fasting is a natural part of the rhythm of life. Shelton's book outlines the History of this practice and explains the following in detail: what is fasting, the purpose of fasting, how to fast successfully, intermittent fasting for healing, and the benefits of fasting in General.Shelton was writing before the advent of genetic Theory and modern medicine. His beliefs were criticized during his time, and he even faced legal penalties for publishing his views. But modern science is now beginning to show that, in some instances, his theories were accurate. Caloric restriction has been repeatedly shown to increase life span in animals, and researchers, such as David Sinclair of Harvard University, have discovered the cellular and genetic mechanisms that respond to such techniques.According to Shelton, when someone is fasting, the energy typically going into eating and digestion is instead redirected to promote health and well-being. Fasting works as a method of resetting the body's metabolism and has a multitude of applications. Shelton divided fasting into two distinct periods: eating and abstaining. Both periods are considered to be vital aspects of the same process. As a child on his family's farm, Shelton observed animals abstain from food when upset, wounded, sick, or just simply not hungry. Shelton came to understand this behavior as a means of survival. Man, as part of the organic world, has many reasons to mimic such behavior and has done so throughout History--as is seen in various religious practices throughout the world. Shelton viewed the purpose of fasting as a natural occurrence that generated healing and restorative benefits. As with animals, Shelton believed abstention from food is sometimes more beneficial than its consumption. For more than 10,000 years, fasting was used to alleviate human illness. In his book, Shelton gives anecdotal evidence of humans fasting for periods of 60 days or more and shows the practice has been known to cure a wide range of Diseases such as epilepsy, typhoid fever, cataracts, and obesity.Over the course of 30 years, Shelton conducted 25,000 fasts ranging from three days to over two months. Throughout the duration of the studies conducted, Shelton found the number of red blood cells increased during a fast and that a General rejuvenation occured. He claims to have observed rapid healing of wounds and various organ Systems in patients undergoing the practice. In one case, a group of university students studied for one week without food and showed remarkable improvement in their performance. He asserted that addicts found relief through fasting and that other mental conditions showed improvement through his methods.Herbert M.Shelton and his works remain popular in the alternative medicine community even today, especially in the realms of fasting and restorative care.",

        details:"The mrdangam is an integral part of the Karnatik stage, its primary percussion instrument. Yet—startling as this is— the instrument as we know it is only a century old. T.M. Krishna investigates the History of the mrdangam and meets the invisible keepers of a tradition: the mrdangam makers.The making process is an intellectually, aesthetically and physically taxing one. From acquiring the skins for the circular membranes and straps to the wood for the drum, from curing the material to the final construction, and at the end of it all, making sure that it has the tone that the mrdangam player wants, mrdangam-making is also a highly nuanced operation at every stage.While several artists have been credited with the evolution of the instrument, including the stalwart Palghat Mani Iyer, none of them had knowledge of a fundamental aspect of the making: hide. The quality of the hide and how it is cured, cut, stretched, bound and braided impacts the tone, timbre and sound of the instrument. This requires a highly tuned ear and an ability to translate abstract ideas expressed by musicians into the corporeal reality of a mrdangam. Yet, their contribution to the art of the mrdangam is dismissed as labour and repair—when it is spoken of at all.There are legendary mrdangam players, yes; there are also distinguished mrdangam makers, many of them from Dalit Christian communities, who remain on the fringes of the Karnatik community. Sebastian and Sons explores the world of these artists, their History, lore and lived experience to arrive at a more organic and holistic understanding of the music that the mrdangam makes.",

In Music: A Subversive History, historian Ted Gioia reclaims the story of music for the riffraff, insurgents, and provocateurs.Gioia tells a four-thousand-year History of music as a global source of power, change, and upheaval. He shows how social outcasts have repeatedly become trailblazers of musical expression: slaves and their descendants, for instance, have repeatedly reinvented music, from ancient times all the way to the jazz, reggae, and hip-hop sounds of the current day.
